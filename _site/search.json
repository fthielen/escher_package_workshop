Gianluca Baio.\nIn this 1-day workshop, we will learn more about how to develop an R package for health economics and to what extend developing your own package can be be useful for your research.\n\n\n\nTo get most out of this workshop, we recommend you to read up on couple of things before you attend:\n\nIf you are not familiar with the basic syntax of R, we recommend you to read the Introduction to R from the R documentation.\nIf you want to read-up on anything related to Data Science and R, we recommend you to read R for Data Science (2e) by Hadley Wickham, Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.\nIf you are not familiar with functions in R, we recommend you to read Chapter 6 Functions from the book Advanced R by Hadley Wickham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you attend the workshop, please make sure you have the following things ready:\n\nR and RStudio: Make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer. You can download R from here and RStudio from here.\n\n\n\n\nThe following things are not mandatory, but they will make your life easier during the workshop. We are aware that the EUR IT-policy might not allow you to install these things on your computer easily, but we still recommend you to have them installed if you want to get most out of the workshop.\n\nR Packages: Make sure you have the following R packages installed: devtools, roxygen2, testthat, usethis\nGit: Make sure you have Git installed on your computer. You can download Git from here or the EUR software center.\nGitHub Account: Make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don‚Äôt have one, you can create one here. In any case, we strongly recommend to upgrade to a free teachers account to get free private repositories and other benefits such as GitHub Copilot.
